# Build Instructions for PhishGuard

## Environment Requirements
- **OS:** Windows / macOS / Linux (Build is cross-platform)
- **Node.js:** Version 18 LTS or higher (Reviewers default to Node 22, which is compatible)
- **Package Manager:** npm (Version 9 or higher)

## Build Steps
1. Unzip the source code archive.
2. Open a terminal in the root directory (where package.json is located).
3. Run the following command to install dependencies (uses package-lock.json for exact versions):
   npm ci
4. Run the build script:
   npm run build
5. The compiled extension will be output to the `dist/` directory.

## Validation
The contents of the `dist/` directory generated by these steps should match the `extension.zip` submitted to AMO.
